# My First Neural Network

I built my first neural network. 
The goal was to predict daily bike rental ridership using a dataset of bike rentals. The network has two layers, one hidden layer and one output layer. I chose to use the sigmoid function for activations. 
Deep learning techniques used in this project include Gradient Descent, Forward Propogation and Backpropogation. 
The code is written in Python 3 and is presented via Jupyter Notebook with the help from numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.
