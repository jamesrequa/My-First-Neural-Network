# My First Neural Network

I built my first neural network from scratch. 
The goal was to predict daily bike rental ridership using a dataset of bike rentals. The network has two layers, one hidden layer and one output layer. The hidden layer uses the sigmoid function for activations. 
Deep learning techniques used in this project include Gradient Descent, Forward Propogation and Backpropogation. 
The code is written in Python (v3) and is presented via Jupyter Notebook with the help from numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.
