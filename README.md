# My First Neural Network

For Project 1 of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree, I built my first neural network from scratch. 
The goal was to predict daily bike rental ridership using a real dataset of bike rentals. 
Deep learning techniques used in this project include Gradient Descent and Backpropogation. 
I have published my data and code using Jupyter Notebook in Python 3 with the help from numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.
